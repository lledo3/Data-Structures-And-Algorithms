/*
You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

Example 1:

Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.

Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 10^5
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5

// Sort + PriorityQueue Solution
// 1. Sort events by start day
// 2. Store end days of in progress events in min heap
// 3. Join the earliest ending in progress evetns from the earliest start event to the latest start evetn.
//    1) Get current date
//    2) Add just started events at current day in the min heap
//    3) Join the earliest ending event
//    4) Remove already ended events
// 4. Do the loop until we explore all the events and the min heap is empty.
// Time complexity: O(NlogN)
// Space complexity: O(N)
