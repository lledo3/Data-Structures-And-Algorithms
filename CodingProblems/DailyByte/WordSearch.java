Given a 2D board that represents a word search puzzle and a string word, return whether or the given 
word can be formed in the puzzle by only connecting cells horizontally and vertically.

Ex: Given the following board and wordsâ€¦

board =
[
  ['C','A','T','F'],
  ['B','G','E','S'],
  ['I','T','A','E']
]

word = "CAT", return true
word = "TEA", return true
word = "SEAT", return true
word = "BAT", return false

/*
Big-O Analysis
Runtime: O(N * 4^M) where N is the total number of cells in our board and M is the length of the word we are searching for. 
This results from (in the worst case) having 4 options at all of our N cells and traversing M neighboring cells from there.
Space complexity: O(M) where M is the length of our word. This results from having M levels of calls on our stack due to our recursion.
