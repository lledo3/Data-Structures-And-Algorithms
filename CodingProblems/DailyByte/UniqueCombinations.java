Backtracking
Given a list of positive numbers without duplicates and a target number, find all unique combinations of the 
numbers that sum to the target. Note: You may use the same number more than once.

Ex: Given the following numbers and targetâ€¦

numbers = [2,4,6,3], target = 6,
return [
    [2,2,2],
    [2,4],
    [3,3],
    [6]
]

    return combinations;

Big-O Analysis
Runtime: O(2N) where N is our total number of numbers. This results from having two choices at each of our N numbers.
Space complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of elements in numbers. This results from having at most N calls 
on our stack from our recursive calls.
