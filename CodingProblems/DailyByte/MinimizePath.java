/*
Given an NxM matrix, grid, where each cell in the matrix represents the cost of stepping on the current cell, 
return the minimum cost to traverse from the top-left hand corner of the matrix to the bottom-right hand corner.
Note: You may only move down or right while traversing the grid.

Ex: Given the following gridâ€¦

grid = [
    [1,1,3],
    [2,3,1],
    [4,6,1]
], return 7.
The path that minimizes our cost is 1->1->3->1->1 which sums to 7.

Big-O Analysis
Runtime: O(N * M) where N is the total number of rows in grid and M is the total number of columns in grid. 
This results from iterating through all the cells in grid.
Space complexity: O(1) or constant since we reuse our grid matrix as our dp array.
